Due to completing the assessment  and realising it slipped my mind it was supposed to be in BDD. I uploaded the project (securitease) I had completed to demonstrate the code, understanding and logic. This project runs flawlessly. 
In my attempt to quickly convert some of the project (securiteasebdd) to BDD, I ran out of time whilst dealing with config issues but the code is there, this is also demonstrate understanding of BDD.
